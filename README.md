- Text to audio conversion: This service uses an audio processing library to convert the text generated by the AI into audio. The service is capable of generating audio in various formats and also supports customization.

- Subtitle addition to the video: This service uses FFmpeg to add subtitles to the video. The service is capable of adding subtitles in multiple languages and also supports customization.
